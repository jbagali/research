Sure, here is a possible implementation of the FSM:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output done); //

    // Insert your code below

    // State transition logic (combinational)
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            state <= case (state)
                IDLE: begin
                    if (in[3] == 1) begin
                        state <= RECEIVING_FIRST_BYTE;
                    end else begin
                        state <= IDLE;
                    end
                end
                RECEIVING_FIRST_BYTE: begin
                    if (in[3] == 0) begin
                        state <= IDLE;
                    end else begin
                        state <= RECEIVING_SECOND_BYTE;
                    end
                end
                RECEIVING_SECOND_BYTE: begin
                    if (in[3] == 0) begin
                        state <= IDLE;
                    end else begin
                        state <= RECEIVING_THIRD_BYTE;
                    end
                end
                RECEIVING_THIRD_BYTE: begin
                    if (in[3] == 0) begin
                        state <= IDLE;
                    end else begin
                        state <= DONE;
                    end
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

    // State flip-flops (sequential)
    reg [1:0] state;

    // Output logic
    assign done = (state == DONE);

endmodule
```

This FSM has four states: IDLE, RECEIVING_FIRST_BYTE, RECEIVING_SECOND_BYTE, and RECEIVING_THIRD_BYTE. In the IDLE state, the FSM waits for the next byte. If the next byte has bit[3] = 1, the FSM enters the RECEIVING_FIRST_BYTE state. In this state, the FSM waits for the second byte. If the second byte has bit[3] = 0, the FSM enters the IDLE state. Otherwise, the FSM enters the RECEIVING_SECOND_BYTE state. In this state, the FSM waits for the third byte. If the third byte has bit[3] = 0, the FSM enters the IDLE state. Otherwise, the FSM enters the DONE state. In the DONE state, the FSM asserts the done output.

The FSM is implemented using a state machine with four states. The state machine is controlled by the input signal in[3]. The state machine transitions to the next state based on the current state and the value of in[3]. The state machine asserts the done output when it is in the DONE state.
