Here is a Verilog code for a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Getting stuck in the final state is intended to model going to other states in a bigger FSM that is not yet implemented. We will be extending this FSM in the next few exercises.

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,
    output start_shifting);

    reg [1:0] state;
    reg start_shifting;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= 0;
        end else begin
            case (state)
                0: begin
                    if (data == '1') begin
                        state <= 1;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 0;
                    end
                end
                1: begin
                    if (data == '1') begin
                        state <= 2;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 0;
                    end
                end
                2: begin
                    if (data == '1') begin
                        state <= 3;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 0;
                    end
                end
                3: begin
                    if (data == '1') begin
                        start_shifting <= 1;
                        state <= 0;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 0;
                    end
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

    assign start_shifting = state == 3;

endmodule
