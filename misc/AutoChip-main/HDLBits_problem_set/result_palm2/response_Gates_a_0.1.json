Sure, here is a Verilog code for a combinational circuit with two inputs, a and b, and 7 outputs, each with a logic gate driving it:

```module top_module( 
    input a, b,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor,
    output out_nand,
    output out_nor,
    output out_xnor,
    output out_anotb
);

    and gate1 (out_and, a, b);
    or gate2 (out_or, a, b);
    xor gate3 (out_xor, a, b);
    nand gate4 (out_nand, a, b);
    nor gate5 (out_nor, a, b);
    xnor gate6 (out_xnor, a, b);
    and gate7 (out_anotb, a, not b);

endmodule
```

This code uses the following logic gates:

* AND gate: The AND gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 1 only if both inputs are 1.
* OR gate: The OR gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 1 if either input is 1.
* XOR gate: The XOR gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 1 if the inputs are different.
* NAND gate: The NAND gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 0 if both inputs are 1.
* NOR gate: The NOR gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 0 if either input is 1.
* XNOR gate: The XNOR gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 1 if the inputs are the same.
* AND-NOT gate: The AND-NOT gate takes one input and produces an output that is 0 if the input is 1, and 1 if the input is 0.

I hope this helps!
