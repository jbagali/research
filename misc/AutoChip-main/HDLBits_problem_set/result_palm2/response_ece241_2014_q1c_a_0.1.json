Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
);

    reg [7:0] s;
    reg overflow;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        s <= a + b;
        overflow <= (s[7] & (a[7] | b[7]));
    end

endmodule
```

The s register stores the sum of a and b. The overflow flag is set if the sum is too large to be represented in 8 bits. This can happen if either a or b is negative and the sum is greater than or equal to 127.
