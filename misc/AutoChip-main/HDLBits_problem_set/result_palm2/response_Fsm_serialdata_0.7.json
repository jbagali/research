Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [7:0] out_byte,
    output done
); //

	// Insert your code below
	
    // Use FSM from Fsm_serial

    // New: Datapath to latch input bits.

    reg [7:0] data_byte;
    reg start_bit_detected;
    reg [7:0] shift_register;
    reg [1:0] state;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            switch (state) begin
                case (IDLE) begin
                    if (in == '1') begin
                        state <= START_BIT;
                    end
                end
                case (START_BIT) begin
                    if (in == '0') begin
                        state <= DATA_BIT;
                        shift_register <= '0';
                    end
                end
                case (DATA_BIT) begin
                    shift_register <= shift_register << 1;
                    shift_register[0] <= in;
                    if (in == '1') begin
                        state <= STOP_BIT;
                    end
                end
                case (STOP_BIT) begin
                    if (in == '0') begin
                        state <= IDLE;
                        data_byte <= shift_register;
                        done <= 1;
                    end
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The FSM in this module is similar to the one in the previous example, but it has an additional state to handle the start bit. The data path consists of a shift register that stores the incoming bits and a flag that indicates when a complete byte has been received. The shift register is clocked on the rising edge of the clock, and the data bit is shifted in on each clock edge. When a stop bit is detected, the data byte is latched into the output register and the done flag is set.
