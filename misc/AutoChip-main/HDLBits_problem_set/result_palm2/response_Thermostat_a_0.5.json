Sure, here is a possible implementation of the heating/cooling thermostat using only assign statements:

```
module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
); 

    heater <= mode & too_cold;
    aircon <= mode & too_hot;
    fan <= heater | aircon | fan_on;

endmodule
```

This implementation uses the following logic:

* The heater is turned on when the mode is heating and it is too cold.
* The air conditioner is turned on when the mode is cooling and it is too hot.
* The fan is turned on when the heater or air conditioner are on, or when the user requests it.

I hope this is helpful!
