Here is the code for the top-level module:

```
module top_module ( input a, input b, output out );

  mod_a mod_a ( .in1(a), .in2(b), .out(out) );

endmodule
```

This code instantiates one instance of the module `mod_a` and connects its three pins (in1, in2, and out) to the top-level module's three ports (wires a, b, and out).
