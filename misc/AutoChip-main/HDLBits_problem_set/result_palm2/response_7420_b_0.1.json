endmodule

The 7420 chip has two 4-input NAND gates. Each NAND gate has four inputs and one output. The output is high if all four inputs are low, and low if any of the inputs are high.

The top_module module has eight inputs and two outputs. The eight inputs are p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d. The two outputs are p1y and p2y.

The p1n1, p1n2, p1n3, and p1n4 wires are the outputs of the four NAND gates in the top_module module. The p2n1, p2n2, p2n3, and p2n4 wires are the outputs of the four NAND gates in the top_module module.

The gate1, gate2, gate3, and gate4 modules are NAND gates. The gate1 module has inputs p1a and p1b, and output p1n1. The gate2 module has inputs p1c and p1d, and output p1n2. The gate3 module has inputs p2a and p2b, and output p2n3. The gate4 module has inputs p2c and p2d, and output p2n4.

The or1 and or2 modules are OR gates. The or1 module has inputs p1n1 and p1n2, and output p1y. The or2 module has inputs p2n3 and p2n4, and output p2y.

The top_module module works by first passing the inputs p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d to the four NAND gates. The NAND gates then output p1n1, p1n2, p1n3, and p1n4, and p2n1, p2n2, p2n3, and p2n4. The or1 and or2 modules then output p1y and p2y, respectively.
