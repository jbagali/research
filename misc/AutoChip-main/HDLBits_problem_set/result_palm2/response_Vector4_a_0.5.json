Here is a circuit that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits:

```
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );

    wire [31:0] sign_extended_number;

    assign sign_extended_number = { in, {24{in[7]}}};

    assign out = sign_extended_number;

endmodule
```

The circuit works by first replicating the sign bit 24 times. This is done by creating a 32-bit vector with all 0 bits except for the sign bit, which is set to 1. The 8-bit input is then concatenated to the front of this vector. The result is a 32-bit number with the sign bit extended to the left.

The circuit can be implemented in any hardware description language (HDL), such as Verilog or VHDL.
