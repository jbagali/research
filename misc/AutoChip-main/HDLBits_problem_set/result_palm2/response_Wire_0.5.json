Here is a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire:

```
module top_module( input in, output out );

  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

This module has one input, `in`, and one output, `out`. The output is assigned to be the same as the input. This means that the module behaves like a wire, passing the input value directly to the output.
