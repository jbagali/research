Here is a possible implementation of a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input shift_ena,
    input count_ena,
    input data,
    output [3:0] q);

    reg [3:0] q;
    reg [3:0] d;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shift_ena) begin
            d <= data;
        end else if (count_ena) begin
            d <= d - 1;
        end
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shift_ena) begin
            q <= d[3];
            d <= d[2:0];
        end
    end

    assign q = q;

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a D flip-flop to store the current value of the shift register, and a 4-bit counter to decrement the value of the shift register when count_ena is asserted. When shift_ena is asserted, the data input is shifted into the shift register, starting with the most significant bit.

This circuit can be used in a variety of applications, such as a timer, a sequencer, or a data shifter.
