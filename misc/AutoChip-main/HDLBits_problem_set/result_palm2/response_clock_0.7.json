This testbench creates one instance of module dut (with instance name dut), and creates a clock signal to drive the module's clk input. The clock has a period of 10 ps. The clock should be initialized to zero with its first transition being 0 to 1.

The always block inside the top_module module ensures that the dut_out signal is updated on every positive edge of the clk signal. The dut_out signal is assigned the value of the dut.dut_out signal on each update.

This testbench can be used to verify the functionality of the dut module.
