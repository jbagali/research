Sure, here is a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of a 4-byte word:

```
module top_module( 
    input [31:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );

    // Insert your code here
    // assign out[31:24] = ...;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= in[23:16] | (in[15:8] << 8) | (in[7:0] << 16) | (in[31:24] << 24);
    end

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a 4-bit register to store the least significant byte of the input word. The register is then clocked four times, each time shifting the data one bit to the right. After four clock cycles, the data in the register will be the most significant byte of the input word. The data is then ORed with the other three bytes of the input word, in reverse order, to produce the output word.
