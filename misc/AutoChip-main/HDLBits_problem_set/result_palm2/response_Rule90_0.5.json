Here is a possible implementation of the Rule 90 cellular automaton in Verilog:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output [511:0] q ); 

    reg [511:0] q;
    reg [511:0] d;
    reg [511:0] dq;
    reg [1:0] clk_cnt;

    // Load the initial state into the register file.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            d <= data;
        end
    end

    // Compute the next state of the cellular automaton.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        dq <= d;
        for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
            dq[i] = dq[i] ^ (d[i - 1] | d[i + 1]);
        end
    end

    // Shift the state register one bit to the right.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= dq;
    end

    // Output the current state of the cellular automaton.
    assign q = q[511:0];
endmodule
```

This circuit uses a register file to store the state of the cellular automaton. The register file has 512 registers, one for each cell in the automaton. The initial state of the automaton is loaded into the register file on the rising edge of the clock signal. On each subsequent clock cycle, the state of the automaton is updated according to the Rule 90 rule. The updated state is then stored in the register file. The output of the circuit is the current state of the cellular automaton.
