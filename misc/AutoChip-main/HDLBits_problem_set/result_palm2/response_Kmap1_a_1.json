The Karnaugh map for the given circuit is as follows:

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);
draw((0,0)--(0.5,0.5));
draw((0.5,0)--(1,0.5));
draw((0,0.5)--(0.5,1));
draw((0.5,0.5)--(1,1));

label("$a$", (0,-0.1), S);
label("$b$", (-0.1,0), E);
label("$c$", (0,1.1), N);
label("$F$", (1.1,0.5), W);

fill((0,0) rectangle (1,1), gray(0.7));
fill((0,0.5) rectangle (1,1), gray(0.7));
fill((0.5,0) rectangle (1,0.5), gray(0.7));
[/asy]

The circuit can be implemented using the following logic gates:

* Two AND gates, one with inputs $a$ and $c$, and the other with inputs $b$ and $c$.
* An OR gate with inputs from the two AND gates.

The output of the OR gate is the desired output, $F$.

Here is the Verilog code for the circuit:

```module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire c,
  output wire out  ); 

  AND gate1 (
    output wire g1,
    input wire a,
    input wire c
  );

  AND gate2 (
    output wire g2,
    input wire b,
    input wire c
  );

  OR gate3 (
    output wire out,
    input wire g1,
    input wire g2
  );

  assign out = g1 | g2;

endmodule
```
