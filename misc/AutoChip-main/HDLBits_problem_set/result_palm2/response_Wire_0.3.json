Sure, here is a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire:

```
module top_module(
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

This module has one input, `in`, and one output, `out`. The output is assigned to be the same as the input. This means that the module behaves like a wire, passing the input signal directly to the output signal.
