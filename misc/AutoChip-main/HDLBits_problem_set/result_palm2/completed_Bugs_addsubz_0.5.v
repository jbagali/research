The following is a bug in the adder-subtractor with zero flag:

```
always @(*) begin
    case (do_sub)
      0: out = a+b;
      1: out = a-b;
    endcase

    if (~out)
        result_is_zero = 1;
    end
```

The bug is that the `if` statement is only checking if the output is zero, but it should also check if the output is negative. If the output is negative, then the result_is_zero flag should also be set to 1.

The following is a fixed version of the adder-subtractor with zero flag:

```
always @(*) begin
    case (do_sub)
      0: out = a+b;
      1: out = a-b;
    endcase

    if (~out) || (out < 0)
        result_is_zero = 1;
    end
```

This version of the code fixes the bug by checking if the output is zero or negative. If the output is zero or negative, then the result_is_zero flag will be set to 1.
