Here is a Verilog code for a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer:

```module top_module(
    input [1023:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output [3:0] out
);

    assign out = in[sel*4+3:sel*4];

endmodule
```

This code uses bit slicing to select the desired 4-bit input from the 1024-bit input vector. The `sel` input selects which 4-bit input to use, and the `out` output is the selected 4-bit input.
