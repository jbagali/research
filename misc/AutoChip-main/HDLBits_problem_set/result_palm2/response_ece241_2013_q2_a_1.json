The minimum SOP form of the output out_sop is $A'B'C'D' + AB'C'D + ABC'D + ABCD$. The minimum POS form of the output out_pos is $A + B + C + D + AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD + ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD$.

To derive the SOP form, we can start by listing all of the possible input combinations. There are 16 possible combinations, since each of the four inputs can be either 0 or 1. Of these 16 combinations, only 3 correspond to a logic-1 output: 2, 7, and 15. We can then express each of these input combinations as a product of literals. For example, the input combination 0001 corresponds to the product $A'B'C'D$. The other two input combinations can be expressed similarly.

Once we have expressed all of the input combinations as products of literals, we can find the minimum SOP form by taking the OR of all of the products that correspond to logic-1 outputs. This gives us the SOP form $A'B'C'D' + AB'C'D + ABC'D + ABCD$.

To derive the POS form, we can start by listing all of the possible input combinations that do not correspond to a logic-1 output. There are 13 possible combinations, since there are 16 possible combinations and 3 of them correspond to a logic-1 output. Of these 13 combinations, all of them correspond to a logic-0 output. We can then express each of these input combinations as a sum of literals. For example, the input combination 0000 corresponds to the sum $A + B + C + D$. The other 12 input combinations can be expressed similarly.

Once we have expressed all of the input combinations as sums of literals, we can find the minimum POS form by taking the AND of all of the sums that correspond to logic-0 outputs. This gives us the POS form $A + B + C + D + AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD + ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD$.
