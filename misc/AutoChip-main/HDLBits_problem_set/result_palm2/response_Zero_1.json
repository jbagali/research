Sure. Here is a circuit with no inputs and one output that outputs a constant 0:

```
module top_module (
    output wire zero
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        zero <= 0;
    end

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a D flip-flop to store the constant 0. The D flip-flop is clocked by the clk signal. When the clk signal goes from low to high, the D flip-flop will latch the value of the zero wire. This value will then be output on the zero wire.

I hope this helps!
