The minimum SOP form of the output out_sop is $a'b'c'd' + a'bc'd + ab'c'd + abc'd + abd' + abcd$. The minimum POS form of the output out_pos is $a + b + c + d + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd + abc + abd + bcd + acd + abcd$.

To arrive at these answers, we first need to find all of the possible input combinations that result in a logic-1 output. These are 0000, 0011, 0111, 1011, and 1111. We can then use these input combinations to generate a truth table for the output.

| a | b | c | d | out_sop | out_pos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

The next step is to simplify the truth table. This can be done by combining rows that have the same output. For example, rows 0000 and 1111 can be combined to give us a new row that has the output 0. This can be done because the only difference between these two rows is the value of the input a, which has no effect on the output.

We can continue this process until we have a truth table with only one row for each possible output. The output for each row will be a product of the inputs that are present in that row. For example, the output for row 0011 is $a'b'c'd$.

The final step is to convert the truth table into SOP and POS form. This can be done by using the following rules:

* A product of inputs in SOP form can be converted to a sum of products in POS form by taking the complement of each input.
* A sum of inputs in POS form can be converted to a product of inputs in SOP form by taking the OR of each input.

Using these rules, we can convert the truth table for the output out_sop into the following SOP form:

$a'b'c'd' + a'bc'd + ab'c'd + abc'd + abd' + abcd$

We can also convert the truth table for the output out_pos into the following POS form:

$a + b + c + d + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd + abc + abd + bcd + acd + abcd$
