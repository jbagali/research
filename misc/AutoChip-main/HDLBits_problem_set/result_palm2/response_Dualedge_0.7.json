Sure, here is a Verilog code for a dual-edge triggered flip-flop:

```module dual_edge_triggered_flip_flop (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output q
);

    always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
        if (rising_edge(clk)) begin
            q <= d;
        end else begin
            q <= q;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This code uses a positive-edge triggered D flip-flop and a negative-edge triggered D flip-flop to implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. The D flip-flops are connected in parallel, and their outputs are ORed together. This ensures that the output of the dual-edge triggered flip-flop is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

The dual-edge triggered flip-flop is a useful building block in many digital circuits. It can be used to implement registers, counters, and other sequential logic circuits.
