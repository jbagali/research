Here is a module that implements an AND gate in Verilog:

```module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This module has three ports: `a`, `b`, and `out`. `a` and `b` are input ports, and `out` is an output port. The `assign` statement assigns the value of the expression `a & b` to the output port `out`. This means that the output port `out` will be high if both inputs `a` and `b` are high, and low otherwise.
