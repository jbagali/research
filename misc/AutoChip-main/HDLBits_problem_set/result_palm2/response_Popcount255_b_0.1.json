Here is a population count circuit for a 255-bit input vector:

```module top_module( 
    input [254:0] in,
    output [7:0] out );
    
    reg [254:0] count;
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        count <= 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) begin
            count <= count + (in[i] == 1);
        end
        out <= count;
    end
endmodule
```

This circuit uses a for loop to iterate over the input vector and count the number of '1's. The count is stored in a register and then output on the rising edge of the clock.
