Here is a possible implementation of a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input x,
    output z
); 

    reg [1:0] state;
    reg [31:0] din;
    reg [31:0] dout;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            state <= 0;
        end else begin
            case (state)
                0: begin
                    if (x == 1'b1) begin
                        state <= 1;
                        din <= x;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 0;
                    end
                end
                1: begin
                    dout <= ~din;
                    state <= 2;
                end
                2: begin
                    dout <= din;
                    state <= 0;
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

    assign z = dout;

endmodule
```

This circuit works as follows:

* When the reset signal is asserted, the state machine is reset to state 0.
* In state 0, the input bit is stored in the register din.
* If the input bit is 1, the state machine transitions to state 1 and the output bit is set to 1.
* In state 1, the output bit is inverted and the state machine transitions to state 2.
* In state 2, the input bit is stored in the register din.
* If the input bit is 0, the state machine transitions to state 0 and the output bit is set to 0.
* The state machine continues to cycle through these states as long as the input bit is present.
* When the input bit is removed, the state machine remains in state 0 and the output bit remains at its last value.
