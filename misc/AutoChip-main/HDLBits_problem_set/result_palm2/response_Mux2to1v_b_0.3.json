Sure, here is a 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input sel,
    output [99:0] out );

    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

The ternary operator (cond ? iftrue : iffalse) is a convenient way to write a conditional expression. In this case, the condition is `sel`, and the two possible values are `b` and `a`. The ternary operator chooses the value of `b` if `sel` is true, and the value of `a` if `sel` is false.

I hope this helps!
