Sure, here is a module that implements an AND gate:

```
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    // AND gate implementation
    assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This module has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. The output is asserted (high) if both inputs are asserted, and deasserted (low) otherwise.
