Sure, here is a module that implements an XNOR gate:

```
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    xor2 #(.WIDTH(1)) gate (
        a, 
        b, 
        out
    );

endmodule
```

The XNOR gate is a logic gate that outputs 1 if its inputs are different, and 0 if its inputs are the same. It is the complement of the XOR gate.
