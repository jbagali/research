Sure, here is a Verilog code for an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block:

```
module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

  always @(a or b) begin
    out_assign = a & b;
  end

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_alwaysblock <= out_assign;
  end

endmodule
```

The assign statement assigns the value of the expression `a & b` to the output wire `out_assign`. The combinational always block always evaluates the expression `a & b` and assigns its value to the output register `out_alwaysblock` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
