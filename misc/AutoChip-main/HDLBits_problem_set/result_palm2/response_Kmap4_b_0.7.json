The Karnaugh map shows that the output is inverted for any change in any input. This can be implemented using a NOT gate for each input, followed by a NOR gate. The NOR gate will output 1 only if all of its inputs are 0, which will be the case if any of the inputs are changed.

The following code implements the circuit:

```
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out  ); 

    NOR gate1 (out, a, b);
    NOR gate2 (out, c, d);

endmodule
```
