Here is a possible implementation of the heating/cooling thermostat using only assign statements:

```
module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
); 

    heater <= (too_cold & mode);
    aircon <= (too_hot & ~mode);
    fan <= (heater | aircon | fan_on);

endmodule
```

The above code uses the following logic:

* The heater is turned on when it is too cold and the thermostat is in heating mode.
* The air conditioner is turned on when it is too hot and the thermostat is in cooling mode.
* The fan is turned on when the heater or air conditioner are on, or when the user requests it.

This implementation is simple and easy to understand, and it can be easily modified to meet specific requirements. For example, if you want to add a delay before the heater or air conditioner turns on, you can simply add a delay element to the appropriate assign statement.
