Sure, here is a 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input sel,
    output [99:0] out );

    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

The multiplexer takes in two inputs, a and b, and a select signal, sel. When sel is 0, the output is a, and when sel is 1, the output is b. The multiplexer is a basic building block in digital logic, and it can be used to create more complex circuits.
