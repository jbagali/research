Here is a Verilog code for a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.

```module top_module( 
    input [2:0] a,
    input [2:0] b,
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out_or_bitwise <= a | b;
        out_or_logical <= a or b;
        out_not[5:3] <= ~b;
        out_not[2:0] <= ~a;
    end

endmodule
```
