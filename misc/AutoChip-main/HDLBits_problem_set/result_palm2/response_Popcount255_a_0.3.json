The following is a Verilog code for a population count circuit for a 255-bit input vector:

```module top_module(
    input [254:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
);

    always @(in) begin
        out <= $countbits(in);
    end

endmodule
```

The `$countbits` function counts the number of 1's in a vector. In this case, the vector is `in`, which is a 255-bit input vector. The result of the `$countbits` function is stored in the output vector `out`, which is a 8-bit vector.
