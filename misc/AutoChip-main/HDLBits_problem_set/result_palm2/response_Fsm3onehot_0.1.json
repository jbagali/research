Here is the Verilog code for the state machine:

```module top_module(
    input in,
    input [3:0] state,
    output [3:0] next_state,
    output out); //

    parameter A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3;

    // Insert your code below

    // State transition logic: Derive an equation for each state flip-flop.
    assign next_state[A] = in ? B : A;
    assign next_state[B] = in ? C : B;
    assign next_state[C] = in ? A : D;
    assign next_state[D] = in ? C : B;

    // Output logic: 
    assign out = state == A;

endmodule
```

The state transition logic is derived by looking at the in-edges of the state transition diagram. For example, the state A has two in-edges, one from state A and one from state B. This means that the next state of A is either A or B, depending on the value of the input. The output logic is simply a function of the current state.
