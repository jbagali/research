Here is a possible implementation of Conway's Game of Life in SystemVerilog:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [255:0] data,
    output [255:0] q ); 

    reg [255:0] q;
    reg [255:0] next_q;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            next_q <= q;
            for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) begin
                for (int j = 0; j < 16; j++) begin
                    next_q[i*16+j] <= (q[i*16+j] == 1) ? (count_neighbors(i, j) == 2) : (q[i*16+j]);
                end
            end
            q <= next_q;
        end
    end

    function int count_neighbors(int i, int j);
        int count = 0;
        for (int di = -1; di <= 1; di++) begin
            for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; dj++) begin
                if (i+di >= 0 && i+di < 16 && j+dj >= 0 && j+dj < 16) begin
                    if (q[i+di*16+j+dj] == 1) begin
                        count++;
                    end
                end
            end
        end
        return count;
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a 256-bit vector to store the current state of the game. The next state of the game is calculated by counting the number of neighbors of each cell. A cell becomes alive if it has exactly 2 neighbors, and dies if it has 0, 1, 3, or 4 neighbors.
