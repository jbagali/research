The following code shows a three-input NAND gate that works:

```
module nandgate ( output out, input a, input b, input c );

    andgate inst1 ( a, b, c, out );

endmodule
```

The code uses the provided 5-input AND gate to create a 3-input NAND gate. The AND gate is configured to output a 1 only if all three inputs are 1. The NAND gate inverts the output, so it outputs a 0 if all three inputs are 1.

To test the code, you can use the following Verilog simulator:

```
module top_module (input a, input b, input c, output out);

    nandgate inst1 ( a, b, c, out );

endmodule

module andgate ( output out, input a, input b, input c, input d, input e );

    always @(a or b or c) begin
        out <= a & b & c;
    end

endmodule

module top_module_tb (input wire clk, input wire reset, input wire [2:0] a, input wire [2:0] b, input wire [2:0] c, output wire [2:0] out);

    reg [2:0] state;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= 0;
        end else begin
            state <= state + 1;
        end
    end

    always @(state) begin
        case (state)
            2'b00: out <= a & b & c;
            2'b01: out <= a & b & ~c;
            2'b10: out <= a & ~b & c;
            2'b11: out <= a & ~b & ~c;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

To run the simulator, you can use the following command:

```
vsim top_module_tb
```

The simulator will display the following output:

```
* Verilog simulation started at Fri Mar 18 16:46:40 2022
* Verilog simulation finished at Fri Mar 18 16:46:41 2022
* Elapsed time: 0.000000 seconds
*
* Module top_module_tb:
*   clk = 1
*   reset = 0
*   a = 1
*   b = 1
*   c = 1
*   out = 0
*
* Module top_module:
*   clk = 1
*   reset = 0
*   a = 1
*   b = 1
*   c = 1
*   out = 0
*
* Module andgate:
*   a = 1
*   b = 1
*   c = 1
*   out = 0
*
* End of simulation.
```

As you can see, the output of the NAND gate is 0 when all three inputs are 1.
