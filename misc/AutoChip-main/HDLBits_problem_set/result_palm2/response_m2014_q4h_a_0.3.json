Here is a possible implementation of the circuit:

```
module top_module (
    input in,
    output out);
    
    // Insert your code here
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (in) begin
            out <= 1;
        else begin
            out <= 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This circuit uses a D flip-flop to store the value of the input signal, and then outputs that value on the output signal. The D flip-flop is configured to be triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal, so the output signal will only change when the input signal changes.
