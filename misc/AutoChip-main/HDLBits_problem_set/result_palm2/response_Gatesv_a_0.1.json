Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```
module top_module( 
    input [3:0] in,
    output [2:0] out_both,
    output [3:1] out_any,
    output [3:0] out_different );

    // Insert your cod here

endmodule
```

The implementation of the module is as follows:

```
// out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding 
// input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] 
// should indicate if in[2] and in[3] are both 1. Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, 
// the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3].

assign out_both[0] = in[0] & in[1];
assign out_both[1] = in[1] & in[2];

// out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding 
// input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] 
// or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0].

assign out_any[0] = in[0];
assign out_any[1] = in[1] | in[2];
assign out_any[2] = in[2] | in[3];

// out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit 
// is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[2] should indicate if in[2] 
// is different from in[3]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[3]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].

assign out_different[0] = in[0] ^ in[1];
assign out_different[1] = in[1] ^ in[2];
assign out_different[2] = in[2] ^ in[3];

endmodule
```
