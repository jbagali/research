Sure, here is a module that implements a NOT gate:

```module top_module(
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = !in;

endmodule
```

This module has two ports: an input port `in` and an output port `out`. The `in` port is connected to the input of the NOT gate, and the `out` port is connected to the output of the NOT gate. The NOT gate inverts its input, so if the input is 1, the output will be 0, and if the input is 0, the output will be 1.
