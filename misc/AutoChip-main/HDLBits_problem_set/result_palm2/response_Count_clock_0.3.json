Here is a possible implementation of a 12-hour clock with am/pm indicator:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input ena,
    output pm,
    output [7:0] hh,
    output [7:0] mm,
    output [7:0] ss); 

    reg [7:0] hh;
    reg [7:0] mm;
    reg [7:0] ss;
    reg pm;

    // Counters for hours, minutes, and seconds
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            hh <= 12;
            mm <= 0;
            ss <= 0;
            pm <= 0;
        end else if (ena) begin
            hh <= hh + 1;
            if (hh == 13) begin
                hh <= 1;
                pm <= 1;
            end
        end
    end

    // Output signals
    assign pm = (hh >= 13);
    assign [7:0] hh = hh;
    assign [7:0] mm = mm;
    assign [7:0] ss = ss;

endmodule
```

This implementation uses three counters to track the hours, minutes, and seconds. The counters are incremented on every positive edge of the clock, and the output signals are updated accordingly. The `pm` signal is set to 1 when the hours are greater than 12, and the `hh` signal is reset to 1 when this happens.
