Sure, here is a module that implements a NOR gate in Verilog:

```
module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = !(a | b);

endmodule
```

This module takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and produces an output, `out`, which is the logical NOT of the OR of `a` and `b`.
