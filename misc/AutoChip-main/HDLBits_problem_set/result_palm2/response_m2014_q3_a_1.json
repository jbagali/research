Here is a possible implementation of the function $f$ in Verilog:

```module top_module (
    input [4:1] x, 
    output f );

    always @(x) begin
        case (x)
            4'b0001: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b0010: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b0100: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b0110: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b1000: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b1010: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b1100: f <= 1'b1;
            4'b1110: f <= 1'b1;
            default: f <= 1'b0;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a case statement to select the output value for each input combination. The case statement is a convenient way to implement a function with many possible output values. The default case is used to handle any input combinations that are not explicitly listed in the case statement.

The output of the case statement is assigned to the signal $f$. The signal $f$ is declared as an output of the module. The module also has an input, $x$, which is a 4-bit signal.

The module is instantiated in the following testbench:

```module top_testbench (
    top_module top,
    output reg [4:1] x, 
    output reg f );

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        x <= $random;
        top.x <= x;
        f <= top.f;
    end

    wire clk;
    reg clk_rst;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            clk_rst <= 1'b1;
        end else begin
            clk_rst <= 1'b0;
        end
    end

    clock clkgen (
        clk, clk_rst
    );

    display dis (
        x, f
    );

endmodule
```

The testbench consists of a clock generator, a display, and a top-level module. The clock generator generates a clock signal. The display displays the values of $x$ and $f$. The top-level module instantiates the top module and connects the signals.

The testbench is run in the following way:

```$ iverilog top_testbench.v
$ vlog top_testbench.v
$ ./a.out

* Simulation time: 500ns

x = 4'b0001
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b0010
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b0100
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b0110
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b1000
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b1010
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b1100
f = 1'b1

x = 4'b1110
f = 1'b1
```

The output of the testbench shows that the function $f$ is implemented correctly.
