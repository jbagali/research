The following code will concatenate the input vectors and split them up into the four output vectors:

```
module top_module (
    input [4:0] a, b, c, d, e, f,
    output [7:0] w, x, y, z );//

    // Assign the input vectors to the first four bits of the output vectors
    assign w = a;
    assign x = b;
    assign y = c;
    assign z = d;

    // Assign the next two bits of the output vectors to 1
    assign w[5:4] = 1;
    assign x[5:4] = 1;

    // Assign the remaining bits of the output vectors to the remaining input vectors
    assign w[3:0] = e;
    assign x[3:0] = f;
    assign y[3:0] = a;
    assign z[3:0] = b;

endmodule
```
