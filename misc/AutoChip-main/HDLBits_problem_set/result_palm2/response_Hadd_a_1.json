Here is a VHDL code for a half adder:

```
module half_adder (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire sum,
  output wire carry
);

  assign sum = a + b;
  assign carry = (a & b) > 1;

endmodule
```

The half adder is a simple digital circuit that adds two bits and produces a sum and carry. The sum is the logical OR of the two bits, and the carry is the logical AND of the two bits. The half adder can be used to build more complex circuits, such as full adders and subtractors.
