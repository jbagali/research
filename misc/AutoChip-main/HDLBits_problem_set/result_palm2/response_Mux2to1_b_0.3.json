Sure, here is a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```module top_module( 
    input a, b, sel,
    output out ); 

    assign out = sel ? b : a; 

endmodule
```

The ternary operator (cond ? iftrue : iffalse) is a convenient way to write a multiplexer. In this case, the condition is `sel`, which is either 0 or 1. If `sel` is 0, then the output is `b`. If `sel` is 1, then the output is `a`.

I hope this helps!
