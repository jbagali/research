Here is a possible implementation of the top_module module:

```
module top_module (
    input a, b, c, d, e,
    output [24:0] out );

    reg [24:0] out;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out = ~{a, a, a, a, a, b, b, b, b, b, c, c, c, c, c, d, d, d, d, d, e, e, e, e, e};
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a register to store the output, which is updated on every positive edge of the clock. The output is calculated by XNORing two vectors created by concatenating and replicating the five inputs.
