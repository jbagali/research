Here is a Verilog code for a circuit that will compute a parity bit for a 8-bit byte (which will add a 9th bit to the byte). We will use "even" parity, where the parity bit is just the XOR of all 8 data bits.

```
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output parity); 
    
    // Compute the parity bit
    always @(in) begin
        parity = in[7] ^ in[6] ^ in[5] ^ in[4] ^ in[3] ^ in[2] ^ in[1] ^ in[0];
    end

endmodule
```

This circuit can be implemented in any hardware description language (HDL), such as Verilog, VHDL, or SystemVerilog. The code above is a Verilog example.
