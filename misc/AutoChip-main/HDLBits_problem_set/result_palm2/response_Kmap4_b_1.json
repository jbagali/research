Here is a possible implementation of the circuit described by the Karnaugh map:

```
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out  ); 

    xor gate1 (
        input a,
        input b,
        output out1  ); 

    xor gate2 (
        input c,
        input d,
        output out2  ); 

    xor gate3 (
        input out1,
        input out2,
        output out  ); 

endmodule
```

The Karnaugh map shows that the output is 1 if and only if both inputs are 0, or both inputs are 1. This can be implemented with an XOR gate, which produces a 1 output if and only if its two inputs are different. The output of the first XOR gate is 1 if and only if either A or B is 0, and the output of the second XOR gate is 1 if and only if either C or D is 0. The output of the third XOR gate is 1 if and only if both the outputs of the first two XOR gates are 1, which is the same as saying that both A and B are 0, or both C and D are 0. This is the desired output.
