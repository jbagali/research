The bug in the three-input NAND gate is that it uses a 5-input AND gate instead of a 3-input AND gate. To fix this, you need to change the module definition of `andgate` to:

```
module andgate ( output out, input a, input b, input c );
```

You also need to change the instantiation of `andgate` in `top_module` to:

```
    andgate inst1 ( a, b, c, out );
```

With these changes, the three-input NAND gate should work properly.
