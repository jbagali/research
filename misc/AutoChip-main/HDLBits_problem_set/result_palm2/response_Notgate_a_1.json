Here is a module that implements a NOT gate:

```
module top_module(
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = !in;

endmodule
```

This module has two ports: `in` and `out`. The `in` port is the input to the NOT gate, and the `out` port is the output. The `assign` statement assigns the value of `!in` to the `out` port. This means that the output of the NOT gate is the inverse of the input.
