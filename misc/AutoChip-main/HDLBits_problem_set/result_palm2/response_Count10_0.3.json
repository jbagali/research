Here is a Verilog code for a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0.

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,        // Synchronous active-high reset
    output [3:0] q);

    reg [3:0] count;
    reg [1:0] state;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 0;
            state <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (state == 0) begin
                count <= count + 1;
                if (count == 10) begin
                    count <= 0;
                    state <= 1;
                end
            end else begin
                state <= 0;
            end
        end
    end

    assign q = count;

endmodule
```

This code uses a two-state machine to control the counter. The state machine has two states: 0 and 1. In state 0, the counter is incremented on every clock edge. When the counter reaches 10, it resets to 0 and the state machine transitions to state 1. In state 1, the counter is held steady. The output of the counter is the value of the counter register.
