Sure. Here is a Verilog code for a circuit with no inputs and one output that outputs a constant 0:

```module top_module (
  output reg zero
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    zero <= 0;
  end

endmodule
```

This circuit consists of a single register, `zero`, which is initialized to 0 at the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. The output of the circuit is simply the value of the register, which is always 0.
