Sure, here is a possible implementation of a 4-way minimum circuit:

```
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a, b, c, d,
    output [7:0] min);//

    wire [7:0] min_a_b;
    wire [7:0] min_c_d;
    wire [7:0] min;

    assign min_a_b = a < b ? a : b;
    assign min_c_d = c < d ? c : d;
    assign min = min_a_b < min_c_d ? min_a_b : min_c_d;

endmodule
```

This circuit works by first comparing each pair of numbers to find the minimum of each pair. The results of these comparisons are then compared to find the overall minimum of the four numbers.
