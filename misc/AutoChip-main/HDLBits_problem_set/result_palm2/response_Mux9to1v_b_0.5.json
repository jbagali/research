Sure, here is a Verilog code for a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer:

```module top_module( 
    input [15:0] a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output [15:0] out );

    always @(sel or a or b or c or d or e or f or g or h or i) begin
        case (sel)
            0: out <= a;
            1: out <= b;
            2: out <= c;
            3: out <= d;
            4: out <= e;
            5: out <= f;
            6: out <= g;
            7: out <= h;
            8: out <= i;
            default: out <= 1'b1;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This code uses a case statement to select the appropriate input signal based on the value of the select signal. For the unused cases (sel=9 to 15), the default case is used, which sets all output bits to '1'.
