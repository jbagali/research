Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [7:0] out_byte,
    output done
); //

	// Insert your code below
	
    // Use FSM from Fsm_serial

    // New: Datapath to latch input bits.

    reg [7:0] data_byte;
    reg [1:0] state;
    reg start_bit;
    reg [7:0] data;
    reg stop_bit;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= 0;
            start_bit <= 1'b0;
            data <= 8'h0;
            stop_bit <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            state <= FSM_serial(state, in);
            if (state == FSM_START) begin
                start_bit <= in;
            end else if (state == FSM_DATA) begin
                data <= data + in;
            end else if (state == FSM_STOP) begin
                stop_bit <= in;
                if (stop_bit) begin
                    data_byte <= data;
                    state <= FSM_IDLE;
                end
            end
        end
    end

    assign out_byte = data_byte;
    assign done = state == FSM_IDLE;

endmodule
```

The FSM is implemented as a state machine with four states: FSM_START, FSM_DATA, FSM_STOP, and FSM_IDLE. The FSM transitions to FSM_DATA when a start bit is detected, to FSM_STOP when a stop bit is detected, and to FSM_IDLE when a byte has been received correctly. The datapath consists of a register to store the received data byte and a logic gate to generate the done signal. The done signal is asserted when the FSM is in the FSM_IDLE state, indicating that a byte has been received correctly.
