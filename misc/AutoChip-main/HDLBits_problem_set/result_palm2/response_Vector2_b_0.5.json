Here is a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of a 4-byte word:

```
module top_module( 
    input [31:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );

    // Insert your code here
    // assign out[31:24] = ...;

    assign out[31:24] = in[23:16];
    assign out[23:16] = in[15:8];
    assign out[15:8] = in[7:0];
    assign out[7:0] = in[31:24];

endmodule
```

This circuit works by using part-select to extract each byte of the input word and then assigning it to the corresponding output bit. For example, the assignment `out[31:24] = in[23:16]` extracts the first byte of the input word, which is stored in bits 23-16, and assigns it to bits 31-24 of the output word. The other assignments work similarly.

This circuit can be implemented in any hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.
