The Karnaugh map shows that the output is inverted for any change in any input. This means that the output is always 1 except when all inputs are 0. This can be implemented with a NOT gate followed by an AND gate with all inputs. The NOT gate inverts the output, so the AND gate will only output 1 when all inputs are 0. The following code implements this circuit:

```
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out  ); 

    // Insert your code here

    NOT(out, a);
    AND(out, b, c, d);

endmodule
```
