Sure, here is a Verilog code that builds an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block:

```
module top_module(
    input a, 
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out_alwaysblock <= a & b;
    end

    assign out_assign = a & b;

endmodule
```

The `always` block is a combinational block that executes whenever the clock signal (`clk`) changes from low to high. The `assign` statement assigns the value of the expression `a & b` to the output wire `out_assign`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
