Here is a Verilog code for a population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector:

```module top_module( 
    input [2:0] in,
    output [1:0] out );

    reg [2:0] count;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (in[2]) begin
                count <= count + 1;
            end
            if (in[1]) begin
                count <= count + 2;
            end
            if (in[0]) begin
                count <= count + 4;
            end
        end
    end

    assign out = count;

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a 3-bit counter to count the number of '1's in the input vector. The counter is initialized to 0 at reset, and then increments each time a '1' is detected in the input vector. The output of the counter is the population count of the input vector.
