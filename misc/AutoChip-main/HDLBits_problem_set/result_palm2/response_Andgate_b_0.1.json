Sure, here is a Verilog module that implements an AND gate:

```module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This module has three ports: `a`, `b`, and `out`. The `a` and `b` ports are inputs, and the `out` port is an output. The `out` port is assigned the value of `a` and `b` ANDed together.
