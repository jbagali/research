Sure, here is a fixed version of the three-input NAND gate:

```module nand3 ( output out, input a, input b, input c );
    andgate inst1 ( a, b, c, out );
    andgate inst2 ( a, b, c, out );
    assign out = ~out;
endmodule
```

The bug in the original code is that the output of the AND gate is directly connected to the input of the NAND gate. This means that the output of the NAND gate will always be 0, regardless of the inputs. The fixed code uses two AND gates to create the NAND gate. The output of the first AND gate is connected to the input of the second AND gate, and the output of the second AND gate is connected to the output of the NAND gate. This ensures that the output of the NAND gate is only 0 when all three inputs are 1.
