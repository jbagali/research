The bug in the 4-to-1 multiplexer is that the output is connected to the input of the second mux2. This means that the output will always be the same as the input, regardless of the value of the select lines.

To fix the bug, you need to connect the output of the first mux2 to the input of the second mux2. You also need to connect the select lines to the inputs of the first mux2.

Here is the fixed code:

```
module mux2 (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    wire mux0;
    mux2 mux0 ( sel,    a,    b, mux0 );

    output [7:0] out = mux0;

endmodule

module top_module (
    input [1:0] sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] out  ); //

    mux2 mux0 ( sel[0],    a,    b, mux0 );
    mux2 mux1 ( sel[1],    c,    d, mux1 );

    output [7:0] out = mux2 ( sel[1], mux0, mux1 );

endmodule
```
