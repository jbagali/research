Here is a possible solution:

```
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
);

    assign s = a + b;

    // Check for overflow
    assign overflow = (a[7] & b[7]) | ((a[7] | b[7]) & s[7]);

endmodule
```

The 2's complement addition algorithm is as follows:

1. Add the two numbers in each bit position, starting from the least significant bit.
2. If the sum of the two bits is greater than $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits in the number, then carry the 1 into the next bit position.
3. Continue adding the bits, carrying as necessary, until all of the bits have been added.
4. The final result is the sum of the two numbers, with any carries that were generated.

In the case of signed numbers, there are two additional cases to consider:

1. If the sum of the two numbers is negative, then the result is a negative number.
2. If the sum of the two numbers is greater than the largest possible signed number, then the result is an overflow.

To check for overflow, we can use the following rule:

The result of adding two signed numbers overflows if the sum of the two absolute values is greater than the largest possible signed number.

In this case, the largest possible signed number is $2^{16}-1$. Therefore, the result of adding two signed numbers overflows if the sum of the two absolute values is greater than $2^{16}-1$.

We can use this rule to generate the condition for overflow as follows:

$$overflow = (a[7] | b[7]) | ((a[7] + b[7]) > 2^{16}-1)$$

This condition is equivalent to the following condition:

$$overflow = (a[7] & b[7]) | ((a[7] | b[7]) & s[7])$$

This condition can be implemented in Verilog as follows:

```
assign overflow = (a[7] & b[7]) | ((a[7] | b[7]) & s[7]);
```
