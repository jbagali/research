Sure, here is the code for the top module:

```
module top_module ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output [7:0] q 
);

    my_dff8 dff1 ( clk, d[7:0], q[7:0] );
    my_dff8 dff2 ( clk, q[7:0], q[6:0] );
    my_dff8 dff3 ( clk, q[6:0], q[5:0] );

    mux4 way_sel ( clk, sel, q[7:0], q[6:0], q[5:0], q );

endmodule
```

The `my_dff8` module is instantiated three times, with the outputs of the first two flip-flops connected to the inputs of the second and third flip-flops, respectively. The output of the third flip-flop is then connected to the input of the 4-to-1 multiplexer. The multiplexer chooses which of the four inputs to output, depending on the value of the `sel` input. The `sel` input can be used to select the value at the input `d`, after the first D flip-flop, after the second D flip-flop, or after the third D flip-flop.
