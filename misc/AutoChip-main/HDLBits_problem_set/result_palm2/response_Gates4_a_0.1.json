Here is a Verilog code for a combinational circuit with four inputs, in[3:0], and three outputs, out_and, out_or, and out_xor:

```module top_module( 
    input [3:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor
);

    AND gate1 (
        input [3:0] a,
        input [3:0] b,
        output out
    );

    OR gate2 (
        input [3:0] a,
        input [3:0] b,
        output out
    );

    XOR gate3 (
        input [3:0] a,
        input [3:0] b,
        output out
    );

    assign out_and = gate1.out;
    assign out_or = gate2.out;
    assign out_xor = gate3.out;

endmodule
```

The AND gate takes two inputs, a and b, and produces an output that is 1 only if both inputs are 1. The OR gate takes two inputs, a and b, and produces an output that is 1 if either input is 1. The XOR gate takes two inputs, a and b, and produces an output that is 1 if the inputs are different.

The Verilog code above defines a module called `top_module` with four inputs, `in[3:0]`, and three outputs, `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor`. The AND gate, OR gate, and XOR gate are defined inside the `top_module` module. The `assign` statement assigns the output of the AND gate to the `out_and` output, the output of the OR gate to the `out_or` output, and the output of the XOR gate to the `out_xor` output.

When the `top_module` module is instantiated, the four inputs, `in[3:0]`, are connected to the four inputs of the AND gate, the OR gate, and the XOR gate. The outputs of the AND gate, OR gate, and XOR gate are connected to the three outputs of the `top_module` module.
