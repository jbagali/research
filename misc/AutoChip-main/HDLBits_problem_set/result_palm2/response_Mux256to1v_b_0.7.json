Sure, here is a Verilog code for a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer:

```module top_module( 
    input [1023:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output [3:0] out );

    assign out = in[sel*4+3:sel*4];

endmodule
```

This code uses bit slicing to select the desired 4-bit input from the 1024-bit input vector. The expression `in[sel*4+3:sel*4]` selects the 4 bits starting at index `sel*4+3`. The synthesizer can easily prove that the width of the selected bits is constant, so this code is valid.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
