Sure, here is a circuit that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits:

```
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign out = { replicate-sign-bit , the-input };

    assign out = { (in[7] & 1) << 24, in };

endmodule
```

The code above uses a bitwise AND operator to create a 32-bit signal with the sign bit of the 8-bit input in the MSB position, followed by the 8-bit input itself.
