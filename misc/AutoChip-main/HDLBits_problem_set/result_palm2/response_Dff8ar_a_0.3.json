Sure, here is a Verilog code for 8 D flip-flops with active high asynchronous reset. All DFFs should be triggered by the positive edge of clk:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input areset,   // active high asynchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] q
);

    reg [7:0] d_reg;
    reg [7:0] q_reg;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            d_reg <= 8'h0;
            q_reg <= 8'h0;
        end else begin
            d_reg <= d;
            q_reg <= d_reg;
        end
    end

    assign q = q_reg;

endmodule
```

This code uses a D flip-flop with positive edge triggering. The D flip-flop is reset when the asynchronous reset signal (areset) is asserted. When the reset signal is de-asserted, the D flip-flop will capture the value of the D input on the next positive edge of the clock signal (clk).
