Here is a possible implementation of the circuit:

```
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input enable,
    input S,
    input A, B, C,
    output Z ); 

    reg [7:0] Q;
    reg [1:0] sel;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (enable) begin
            Q <= Q << 1;
            if (S) begin
                Q[0] <= A;
                Q[1] <= B;
                Q[2] <= C;
            end
        end
    end

    mux4way #(8) M (
        [7:0] Q,
        [1:0] sel,
        output Z
    );

endmodule
```

The 8-bit shift register is implemented using D-type flip-flops. The shift register input, S, is fed to the input of Q[0], which is the most significant bit (MSB). The enable input controls whether to shift. When enable is high, the contents of the shift register are shifted left by one bit. The 3-input logic function is implemented using a multiplexer. The multiplexer selects the output of the shift register based on the values of A, B, and C. When ABC is 000, Z is equal to Q[0]. When ABC is 001, Z is equal to Q[1], and so on.
