The following code contains incorrect behavior that creates a latch. Fix the bugs so that you will shut off the computer only if it's really overheated, and stop driving if you've arrived at your destination or you need to refuel.

```
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  ); //

    // Fix the bug in teh following code
    
    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
           shut_off_computer = 1;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived)
           keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
    end

endmodule
```

The problem with the above code is that the `shut_off_computer` signal is being updated twice per clock cycle, once in the `always @(*)` block that checks for CPU overheating, and once in the `always @(*)` block that checks for arrival at the destination. This can cause the `shut_off_computer` signal to oscillate, which is not what we want.

To fix this problem, we need to make sure that the `shut_off_computer` signal is only updated once per clock cycle. We can do this by using a gated clock. A gated clock is a clock that is only enabled when a certain condition is met. In this case, we want the `shut_off_computer` signal to be updated only when the CPU is overheating.

We can implement a gated clock using a D flip-flop. A D flip-flop is a type of digital circuit that stores one bit of data. It has two inputs, a data input (D) and a clock input (CLK). The data input is the value that will be stored in the flip-flop. The clock input is a signal that tells the flip-flop when to update its state.

When the clock input is high, the D flip-flop will store the value on the data input. When the clock input is low, the D flip-flop will hold its current state.

We can use a D flip-flop to implement a gated clock by connecting the clock input to the `cpu_overheated` signal. This will cause the D flip-flop to only update its state when the CPU is overheating.

We can then connect the output of the D flip-flop to the `shut_off_computer` signal. This will ensure that the `shut_off_computer` signal is only updated when the CPU is overheating.

The following code shows how to implement a gated clock using a D flip-flop:

```
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  ); //

    // Fix the bug in teh following code
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
           shut_off_computer = 1;
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (~arrived)
           keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
    end

    // Gated clock
    D flip_flop (
        input clk,
        input reset,
        input d,
        output q
    );

    // Connect the clock input of the D flip-flop to the `cpu_overheated` signal
    assign clk = cpu_overheated;

    // Connect the output of the D flip-flop to the `shut_off_computer` signal
    assign shut_off_computer = q;

endmodule
```

The above code fixes the bug in the original code and ensures that the `shut_off_computer` signal is only updated when the CPU is overheating.
