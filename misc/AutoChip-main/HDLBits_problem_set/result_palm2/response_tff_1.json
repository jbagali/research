The testbench instantiates one T flip-flop and connects its inputs and outputs to the testbench's signals. The initial block sets the reset signal to 1 and the toggle signal to 0. After 10 clock cycles, the reset signal is set to 0 and the toggle signal is set to 1. After another 10 clock cycles, the simulation stops.
