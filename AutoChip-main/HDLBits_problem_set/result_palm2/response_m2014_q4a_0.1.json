Sure, here is a D flip-flop implemented in Verilog:

```module top_module (
    input d, 
    input ena,
    output q);
    
    reg q;
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (ena) begin
            q <= d;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This D flip-flop uses a D flip-flop with a positive edge-triggered clock. The input signal `d` is stored in the flip-flop when the clock signal `clk` goes from low to high. The output signal `q` is the value of the data signal `d` that was stored in the flip-flop on the last positive edge of the clock signal.

This D flip-flop can be used to implement a variety of digital circuits, such as counters, registers, and shift registers.
