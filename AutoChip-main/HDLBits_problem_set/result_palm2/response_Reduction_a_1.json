This circuit uses a XOR gate to compute the parity bit. The XOR gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is 1 if the inputs are different, and 0 if the inputs are the same. In this case, the inputs to the XOR gate are the 8 data bits. If there is an even number of 1 bits in the data, the parity bit will be 0. If there is an odd number of 1 bits in the data, the parity bit will be 1.

This circuit can be used to detect errors in data transmission. If the data is received with an incorrect parity bit, it is likely that there was an error in transmission.
