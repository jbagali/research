The 4-to-1 multiplexer is used to select between the four possible values of $a'b'c'd'$, $a'b'cd$, $ab'c'd$, and $ab'cd'$. The 2-to-1 multiplexers are used to select between the two possible values of $a'b$ and $ab$.

The output of the 4-to-1 multiplexer is connected to the input of the first 2-to-1 multiplexer, and the output of the second 2-to-1 multiplexer is connected to the input of the third 2-to-1 multiplexer. The outputs of the three 2-to-1 multiplexers are connected to the inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

The following table shows the truth table for the circuit:

| $a$ | $b$ | $c$ | $d$ | $a'b'c'd'$ | $a'b'cd$ | $ab'c'd$ | $ab'cd'$ |
