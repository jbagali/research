Sure, here is the code for a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```
module top_module(
  input a,
  input b,
  input sel,
  output out
);

  assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

This code uses a multiplexer to select between two inputs, `a` and `b`, based on the value of the select input, `sel`. When `sel` is 0, the output will be `a`, and when `sel` is 1, the output will be `b`.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
