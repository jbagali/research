Here is a possible implementation of the function $f$ shown in the Karnaugh map:

```
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x, 
    output f );

    wire [4:0] a;
    assign a[0] = x[0];
    assign a[1] = x[1];
    assign a[2] = x[2];
    assign a[3] = x[3];

    wire [4:0] b;
    assign b[0] = x[1] & x[2];
    assign b[1] = x[1] & x[3];
    assign b[2] = x[2] & x[3];
    assign b[3] = x[1] | x[2] | x[3];

    wire f;
    assign f = a[0] & b[0] | a[1] & b[1] | a[2] & b[2] | a[3] & b[3];

endmodule
```

This implementation uses four 2-input AND gates and one OR gate. The AND gates are used to select the terms from the Karnaugh map, and the OR gate is used to combine the selected terms. The output of the OR gate is the value of $f$.
