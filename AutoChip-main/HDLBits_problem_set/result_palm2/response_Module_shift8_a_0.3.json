Sure, here is the code for the top module:

```
module top_module ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output [7:0] q 
);

    my_dff8 dff1 (clk, d[7:0], q[7:0]);
    my_dff8 dff2 (clk, q[7:0], q[6:0]);
    my_dff8 dff3 (clk, q[6:0], q[5:0]);

    mux4 #(8) mux (clk, sel, q[7:0], q[6:0], q[5:0], q[4:0]);

    output [7:0] q;

    assign q = mux.y;

endmodule
```

The module `my_dff8` is a D flip-flop with two inputs and one output. The input `clk` is the clock signal, the input `d` is the data signal, and the output `q` is the output signal. The module `top_module` instantiates three instances of `my_dff8` and chains them together to make a 8-bit wide shift register of length 3. In addition, it creates a 4-to-1 multiplexer that chooses what to output depending on `sel[1:0]`: the value at the input `d`, after the first D flip-flop, after the second D flip-flop, or after the third D flip-flop. (Essentially, `sel` selects how many cycles to delay the input, from zero to three clock cycles.)
