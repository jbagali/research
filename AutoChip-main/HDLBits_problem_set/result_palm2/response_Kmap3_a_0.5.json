The Karnaugh map can be simplified to the following product-of-sums form:

$$f(a, b, c, d) = (a'b' + ab' + ac'd + acd')$$

or the following sum-of-products form:

$$f(a, b, c, d) = (a'b' + ab + ac' + ad + bc' + bd)$$

The circuit can be implemented using either AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates, or NAND gates and NOR gates.

Here is a circuit implementation using AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates:

[Circuit diagram]

The circuit works as follows:

* The AND gates in the top row implement the terms $a'b'$, $ab'$, $ac'$, and $acd'$.
* The OR gates in the middle row implement the terms $a'b' + ab' + ac'd + acd'$.
* The NOT gate at the bottom inverts the output of the OR gate, giving the final output $f(a, b, c, d)$.

Here is a circuit implementation using NAND gates and NOR gates:

[Circuit diagram]

The circuit works as follows:

* The NAND gates in the top row implement the terms $a'b'$, $ab'$, $ac'$, and $acd'$.
* The NOR gates in the middle row implement the terms $\overline{a'b'} + \overline{ab'} + \overline{ac'} + \overline{acd'}$.
* The NOT gate at the bottom inverts the output of the NOR gate, giving the final output $f(a, b, c, d)$.
