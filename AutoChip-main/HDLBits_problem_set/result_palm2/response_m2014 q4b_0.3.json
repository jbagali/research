Sure, here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d, 
    input ar,   // asynchronous reset
    output q);

    reg [1:0] state;
    reg q;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge ar) begin
        if (ar) begin
            state <= 1;
        end else begin
            if (state == 1) begin
                q <= d;
                state <= 0;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a D flip-flop to store the current state of the circuit. The state is initialized to 0 when the asynchronous reset signal is asserted. When the clock signal is asserted, the state is updated to 1 if the asynchronous reset signal is not asserted. If the state is 1, the output is updated to the value of the data input.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
