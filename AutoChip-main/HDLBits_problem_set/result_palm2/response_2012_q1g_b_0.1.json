The Karnaugh map shows that the function $f$ is true when $x_1x_2x_3x_4 = 0001$ or $x_1x_2x_3x_4 = 1110$. This can be implemented with the following logic circuit:

```
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x,
    output f
); 

    assign f = (x[1] & x[2] & ~x[3] & ~x[4]) | (~x[1] & ~x[2] & x[3] & x[4]);

endmodule
```

The circuit consists of two AND gates and an OR gate. The AND gates select the two combinations of input bits that make $f$ true. The OR gate combines the outputs of the AND gates to produce the final output $f$.
