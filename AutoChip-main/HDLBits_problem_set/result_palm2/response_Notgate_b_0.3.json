Sure, here is a module that implements a NOT gate in Verilog:

```module top_module (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

The `~` operator is the bitwise-NOT operator in Verilog. It inverts all the bits of its input. The `!` operator is the logical-NOT operator. It inverts the logical value of its input, which is 1 if the input is 0 and 0 if the input is 1. Since we're working with a one-bit here, it doesn't matter which operator we choose.

The `assign` statement assigns the value of the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side. In this case, we're assigning the output `out` to the bitwise-NOT of the input `in`.

The `endmodule` statement marks the end of the module.
