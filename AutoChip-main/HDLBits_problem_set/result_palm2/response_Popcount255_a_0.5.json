Here is a Verilog implementation of a population count circuit for a 255-bit input vector:

```module top_module(
    input [254:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
);

    wire [254:0] count;

    // Count the number of '1's in each 8-bit slice of the input vector.
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        count[i] = __builtin_popcount(in[i*8+7:i*8]);
    }

    // Add up the counts of '1's in each 8-bit slice to get the total population count.
    out = count[0] + count[1] + count[2] + count[3] + count[4] + count[5] + count[6] + count[7];

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a combination of bitwise AND, OR, and NOT operations to count the number of '1's in each 8-bit slice of the input vector. The results of these counts are then added together to get the total population count.
