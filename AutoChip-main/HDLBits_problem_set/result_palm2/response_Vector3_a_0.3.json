Sure, here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module (
    input [4:0] a, b, c, d, e, f,
    output [7:0] w, x, y, z );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign { ... } = { ... };

    assign w = a;
    assign x = b + c;
    assign y = d + e;
    assign z = f + 1'b1 + 1'b1;

endmodule
```

This implementation concatenates the input vectors a, b, c, d, e, and f together, then splits them up into four 8-bit output vectors: w, x, y, and z. The output vectors are defined as follows:

* w = a
* x = b + c
* y = d + e
* z = f + 1'b1 + 1'b1

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
