The bug in the 4-to-1 multiplexer is that the second mux2 is not necessary. The output of the first mux2 is already the desired value, so there is no need to multiplex it again. The correct circuit is as follows:

```
module mux2 (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

module top_module (
    input [1:0] sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] out  ); //

    wire mux0;
    mux2 mux0 ( sel[0],    a,    b, mux0 );

    assign out = mux0;

endmodule
```

This circuit will correctly select the desired input based on the value of sel.
