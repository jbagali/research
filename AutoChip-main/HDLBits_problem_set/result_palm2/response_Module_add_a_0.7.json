Here is a possible implementation of the 32-bit adder:

```module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);

    add16 add16_low (
        input [15:0] a_low,
        input [15:0] b_low,
        input cin,
        output [15:0] sum_low,
        output cout_low
    );

    add16 add16_high (
        input [15:0] a_high,
        input [15:0] b_high,
        input cout_low,
        output [15:0] sum_high,
        output cout_high
    );

    assign sum = sum_low + sum_high;
endmodule
```

The `add16` module is instantiated twice, once for the lower 16 bits of the addition and once for the upper 16 bits. The carry-out from the lower 16-bit addition is connected to the carry-in of the upper 16-bit addition. The sum of the two 16-bit additions is the final result.
