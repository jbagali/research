Here is a possible implementation of the heating/cooling thermostat circuit using only assign statements:

```
module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
); 

    heater <= (mode == 1) && too_cold;
    aircon <= (mode == 0) && too_hot;
    fan <= heater | aircon | fan_on;

endmodule
```

This circuit works as follows:

* When the mode is set to heating (mode = 1), the heater will turn on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1).
* When the mode is set to cooling (mode = 0), the air conditioner will turn on when it is too hot (too_hot = 1).
* When the heater or air conditioner are on, the fan will also turn on to circulate the air.
* The fan can also be turned on manually by the user (fan_on = 1), even if the heater and air conditioner are off.

This circuit can be implemented using a variety of logic gates, such as AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates. The specific implementation will depend on the desired level of performance and cost.
