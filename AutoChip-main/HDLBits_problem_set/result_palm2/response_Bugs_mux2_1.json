The bug in the 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer is that the '~' operator is used to invert the value of the 'sel' input, but this is not necessary. The 'sel' input is already a boolean value, so it can be used directly in the Boolean expression for the 'out' output. The correct code is as follows:

```module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output out  );

    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

The '?' operator is called a conditional operator. It takes three operands: a condition, a true value, and a false value. The condition is evaluated, and if it is true, the true value is returned. If the condition is false, the false value is returned. In this case, the condition is the 'sel' input. If the 'sel' input is true, then the value of 'b' is returned for the 'out' output. If the 'sel' input is false, then the value of 'a' is returned for the 'out' output.
