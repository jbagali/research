Here is a Verilog code that implements the circuit to process scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard for a game:

```
module top_module (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up  ); 

    // Insert your code here

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        case (scancode[15:0])
            16'he06b: left <= 1'b1;
            16'he072: down <= 1'b1;
            16'he074: right <= 1'b1;
            16'he075: up <= 1'b1;
            default: ;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This code uses a case statement to map the scancodes to the corresponding output signals. The case statement is evaluated on the positive edge of the clock signal, clk. The scancode is stored in the register scancode[15:0]. The case statement compares the scancode to the four possible values for the arrow keys. If the scancode matches one of the four values, the corresponding output signal is set to 1. Otherwise, the output signal is set to 0.
