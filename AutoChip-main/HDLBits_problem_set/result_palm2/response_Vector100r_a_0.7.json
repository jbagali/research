Sure. Here is a combinational always block that reverses the bit ordering of a 100-bit input vector:

```
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output [99:0] out
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) begin
            out[99 - i] <= in[i];
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This always block uses a for loop to iterate over the input vector, from 0 to 99. For each iteration, the output vector is updated by assigning the value of the input vector at index $i$ to the output vector at index $99 - i$. This effectively reverses the bit ordering of the input vector.

I hope this helps!
