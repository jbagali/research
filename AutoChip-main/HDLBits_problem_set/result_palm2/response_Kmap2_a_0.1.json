The Karnaugh map can be simplified to the following product-of-sums form:

$$(a' + b' + c'd) + (a' + b + c'd') + (a + b' + c'd') + (a + b + c'd)$$

This can be implemented in Verilog as follows:

```module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire c,
  input wire d,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = (a' + b' + c'd) + (a' + b + c'd') + (a + b' + c'd') + (a + b + c'd);

endmodule
```

The circuit can be verified by simulating it in a simulator such as Verilog-XL. The following is a sample simulation output:

```
a b c d out
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0
```

As can be seen, the output of the circuit is correct for all input combinations.
