Here is a Verilog code for a 8-bit D flip-flop with active high synchronous reset:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,            // Synchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] q
);

    reg [7:0] q;
    reg [7:0] d_reg;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 8'h0;
        end else begin
            q <= d_reg;
        end
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            d_reg <= 8'h0;
        end else begin
            d_reg <= d;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This code uses a D flip-flop to store the value of the input D on the positive edge of the clock. The flip-flop is reset to 0 when the reset input is asserted.
