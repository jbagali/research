Here is a possible solution in Verilog:

```module top_module(
  input [99:0] in,
  output [98:0] out_both,
  output [99:1] out_any,
  output [99:0] out_different
);

  reg [99:0] out_both;
  reg [99:1] out_any;
  reg [99:0] out_different;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_both <= in[99:0] & in[98:1];
    out_any <= in[99:1] | in[98:0];
    out_different <= in[99:0] ^ in[98:1];
  end

endmodule
```

The `out_both` output vector is generated by ANDing the input vector with itself shifted left by one bit. This ensures that the output bit is only 1 if both the corresponding input bit and its neighbor to the left are 1.

The `out_any` output vector is generated by ORing the input vector with itself shifted right by one bit. This ensures that the output bit is 1 if either the corresponding input bit or its neighbor to the right is 1.

The `out_different` output vector is generated by XORing the input vector with itself shifted left by one bit. This ensures that the output bit is 1 if the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbor to the left.
