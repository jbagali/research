The following circuit implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, but using as few as possible. The 4-to-1 multiplexer is used to select the output of the 2-to-1 multiplexers, which are used to implement the four minterms of the function.

```
module top_module (
    input c,
    input d,
    output [3:0] mux_in
); 

    // 4-to-1 multiplexer
    4to1mux u1 (
        input [1:0] sel,
        input [3:0] a,
        input [3:0] b,
        output [3:0] y
    );

    // 2-to-1 multiplexer
    2to1mux u2 (
        input sel,
        input x,
        input y,
        output z
    );

    // Minterm 1
    assign mux_in[0] = u1.y[0];

    // Minterm 2
    assign mux_in[1] = u2.z[0];

    // Minterm 3
    assign mux_in[2] = u2.z[1];

    // Minterm 4
    assign mux_in[3] = u1.y[1];

endmodule
```

The 4-to-1 multiplexer is configured to select the output of the 2-to-1 multiplexer that is connected to the minterm that is true for the given inputs. For example, if the inputs are $c=0$ and $d=1$, then the 4-to-1 multiplexer will select the output of the 2-to-1 multiplexer that is connected to the minterm 2, which is $a'b'$.
