Sure, here is a full adder circuit in Verilog:

```module top_module (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire cin,
  output wire cout,
  output wire sum
);

  assign cout = a ^ b ^ cin;
  assign sum = a + b + cin;

endmodule
```

This circuit uses the XOR, AND, and OR gates to implement the full adder. The XOR gate is used to detect the carry-out, the AND gate is used to detect the sum, and the OR gate is used to combine the carry-out and sum to produce the output.

The full adder is a basic building block in digital logic, and it can be used to create more complex circuits such as adders, subtractors, and multipliers.
