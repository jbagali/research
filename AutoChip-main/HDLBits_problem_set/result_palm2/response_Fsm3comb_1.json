Sure, here is the Verilog code for the Moore state machine:

```module top_module (
  input wire in,
  input wire [1:0] state,
  output wire [1:0] next_state,
  output wire out
);

  parameter A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3;

  // State transition logic: next_state = f(state, in)
  assign next_state = ({
    when (state == A and in == 0) => B,
    when (state == A and in == 1) => B,
    when (state == B and in == 0) => C,
    when (state == B and in == 1) => B,
    when (state == C and in == 0) => A,
    when (state == C and in == 1) => D,
    when (state == D and in == 0) => C,
    when (state == D and in == 1) => B
  });

  // Output logic: out = f(state) for a Moore state machine
  assign out = state;

endmodule
```
