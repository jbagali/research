The following is a combinational circuit that implements the above truth table:

```
module top_module( 
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,  // three inputs
    output f   // one output
);

    // OR gate
    xor3 u1 (f, x3, x2, x1);

endmodule
```

The OR gate takes three inputs and produces an output that is 1 if any of the inputs are 1. In this case, the output will be 1 if any of the inputs x3, x2, or x1 are 1. This is the desired behavior, as the truth table shows that the output is 1 for four of the eight possible input combinations.
