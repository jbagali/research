Sure, here is a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of a 4-byte word:

```
module top_module( 
    input [31:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );

    // Insert your code here
    // assign out[31:24] = ...;

    assign out[31:24] = in[23:16];
    assign out[23:16] = in[15:8];
    assign out[15:8] = in[7:0];
    assign out[7:0] = in[31:24];

endmodule
```

This circuit uses four 8-bit registers to store the four bytes of the input word. The registers are then connected in a daisy chain, with the output of each register connected to the input of the next register. This effectively reverses the order of the bytes. The output of the last register is then connected to the output of the circuit.

I hope this helps!
