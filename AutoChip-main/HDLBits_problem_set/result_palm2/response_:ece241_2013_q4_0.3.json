Here is a Moore model for the water reservoir controller:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [3:1] s,
    output fr3,
    output fr2,
    output fr1,
    output dfr
); 

    parameter [3:0] STATES = 4;
    parameter [3:0] INIT_STATE = 0;

    reg [3:0] state;
    reg [1:0] fr;
    reg [1:0] dfr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= INIT_STATE;
            fr <= 0;
            dfr <= 0;
        end else begin
            switch (state) begin
                case (0) :
                    if (s[2]) begin
                        state <= 1;
                        fr <= 0;
                        dfr <= 0;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 0;
                        fr <= 0;
                        dfr <= 0;
                    end
                case (1) :
                    if (s[1]) begin
                        state <= 2;
                        fr <= 1;
                        dfr <= 0;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 1;
                        fr <= 0;
                        dfr <= 0;
                    end
                case (2) :
                    if (s[0]) begin
                        state <= 3;
                        fr <= 1;
                        dfr <= 1;
                    end else begin
                        state <= 2;
                        fr <= 1;
                        dfr <= 0;
                    end
                case (3) :
                    state <= 3;
                    fr <= 1;
                    dfr <= 1;
            endcase
        end
    end

    assign fr3 = fr[1];
    assign fr2 = fr[0];
    assign fr1 = fr[0];
    assign dfr = dfr[1];

endmodule
```

This FSM has four states, corresponding to the four possible water levels. The state machine transitions from one state to the next based on the inputs $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$. When the water level is above $s_3$, the state machine remains in state 0 and all outputs are 0. When the water level is between $s_3$ and $s_2$, the state machine transitions to state 1 and the output $fr_1$ is asserted. When the water level is between $s_2$ and $s_1$, the state machine transitions to state 2 and the outputs $fr_1$ and $fr_2$ are asserted. When the water level is below $s_1$, the state machine transitions to state 3 and all outputs are asserted.

The output $dfr$ is asserted when the water level is decreasing. This is useful for controlling a supplemental flow valve that can be used to increase the flow rate when the water level is low.
