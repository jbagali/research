Here is a population count circuit for a 255-bit input vector:

```module top_module( 
    input [254:0] in,
    output [7:0] out );
    
    // Count the number of 1's in each 8-bit slice of the input vector.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
            reg [7:0] count = 0;
            for (int j = 7; j >= 0; j--) begin
                count += (in[i*8+j] == 1);
            end
            out[i] = count;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This circuit uses a for loop to iterate over each 8-bit slice of the input vector. In each iteration, the counter is initialized to 0 and then incremented for each 1-bit in the slice. The final value of the counter is stored in the corresponding output bit.
