The bug in the 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer is that the output is not correctly assigned. The output should be equal to the value of the selected input, but it is currently equal to the OR of the two inputs. To fix this bug, the assignment statement should be changed to:

```
assign out = sel ? a : b;
```

This will ensure that the output is always equal to the value of the selected input.
