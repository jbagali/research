Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```
module top_module (
    input a, b, c, d, e,
    output [24:0] out );//

    // The output is XNOR of two vectors created by 
    // concatenating and replicating the five inputs.
    // assign out = ~{ ... } ^ { ... };
    // Insert your code below

    assign out = ~{ a, a, a, a, a, a, b, b, b, b, b, b, c, c, c, c, c, c, d, d, d, d, d, d, e, e, e, e, e, e };

endmodule
```

The output of the module is a 25-bit vector, with the following meaning:

* bit 0: a == a
* bit 1: a == b
* bit 2: a == c
* bit 3: a == d
* bit 4: a == e
* bit 5: b == b
* bit 6: b == c
* bit 7: b == d
* bit 8: b == e
* bit 9: c == c
* bit 10: c == d
* bit 11: c == e
* bit 12: d == d
* bit 13: d == e
* bit 14: e == e
* bit 15: a == b ^ c
* bit 16: a == b ^ d
* bit 17: a == b ^ e
* bit 18: a == c ^ d
* bit 19: a == c ^ e
* bit 20: a == d ^ e
* bit 21: b == c ^ d
* bit 22: b == c ^ e
* bit 23: b == d ^ e
* bit 24: c == d ^ e

The XNOR operation is defined as follows:

$$x \oplus y = \neg(x \land y) \lor (x \lor y)$$

In other words, the XNOR of two bits is 1 if and only if the two bits are different.
