Sure, here is a module that implements an AND gate:

```
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    // AND gate
    assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This module has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. The output is asserted (`1`) if both inputs are asserted (`1`), and de-asserted (`0`) otherwise.
