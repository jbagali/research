Sure, here is a module that implements a NOT gate in Verilog:

```module top_module (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

This module has two ports: an input port `in` and an output port `out`. The `~` operator is the bitwise NOT operator, which inverts all the bits of its input. The `assign` statement assigns the value of the expression on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side. In this case, the expression is `~in`, which is the bitwise NOT of the input value `in`. This means that the output value `out` will always be the opposite of the input value `in`.
