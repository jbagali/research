Sure, here is a Verilog implementation of the top module:

```
module top_module (
    input [3:0] in,
    output [2:0] out_both,
    output [3:1] out_any,
    output [3:0] out_different
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out_both = '0';
        out_any = '0';
        out_different = '0';

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) begin
            if (in[i] == in[i+1]) begin
                out_both[i/2] = '1';
            end

            if (in[i] || in[i+1]) begin
                out_any[i/2] = '1';
            end

            if (in[i] != in[i+1]) begin
                out_different[i/2] = '1';
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The `always` block is clocked by the `clk` signal. Inside the block, we first initialize the output signals to 0. Then, we loop over the input bits, from 0 to 2. For each input bit, we check whether it is equal to its neighbor to the left. If it is, we set the corresponding bit of `out_both` to 1. We also check whether the input bit is 1 or not. If it is, we set the corresponding bit of `out_any` to 1. Finally, we check whether the input bit is different from its neighbor to the left. If it is, we set the corresponding bit of `out_different` to 1.

I hope this helps!
