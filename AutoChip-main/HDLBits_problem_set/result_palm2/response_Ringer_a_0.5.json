Sure, here is a possible solution in Verilog:

```module top_module (
    input ring,
    input vibrate_mode,
    output ringer,       // Make sound
    output motor         // Vibrate
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (ring) begin
            if (vibrate_mode) begin
                motor = 1;
            else begin
                ringer = 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates to implement the desired logic. The AND gate ensures that both the ring and vibrate_mode inputs are high before the motor output is asserted. The OR gate ensures that either the ring or vibrate_mode input is high before the ringer output is asserted. The NOT gate inverts the vibrate_mode input, so that when it is high, the motor output is low.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
