Sure. Here is a Verilog implementation of a 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton:

```module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output [511:0] q
); 

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
                q[i] <= rule110(q[i], q[i + 1], q[i + 2]);
            end
        end
    end

    function wire rule110(wire in0, wire in1, wire in2);
        case (in0, in1, in2)
            (1, 1, 1) : return 0;
            (1, 1, 0) : return 1;
            (1, 0, 1) : return 1;
            (1, 0, 0) : return 0;
            (0, 1, 1) : return 1;
            (0, 1, 0) : return 1;
            (0, 0, 1) : return 1;
            (0, 0, 0) : return 0;
        endcase
    endfunction

endmodule
```

This circuit uses a 512-bit shift register to store the state of the system. The shift register is clocked by the clk signal, and the data is loaded into the shift register on the rising edge of the load signal. The rule110 function is used to compute the next state of each cell, based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors. The next state of each cell is stored in the shift register, and the process repeats on the next clock cycle.
