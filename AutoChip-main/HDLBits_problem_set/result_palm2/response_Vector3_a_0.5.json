The following code implements the concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits:

```
module top_module (
    input [4:0] a, b, c, d, e, f,
    output [7:0] w, x, y, z );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign { ... } = { ... };

    assign w = a + b + c + d + e + f;
    assign x = w + 1;
    assign y = x + 1;
    assign z = y + 1;

endmodule
```

The input vectors are first concatenated together to form a 30-bit vector. This vector is then divided into four 8-bit vectors, w, x, y, and z, with the two 1 bits being placed in the last two positions of w.
