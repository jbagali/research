Here is a circuit that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits:

```
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign out = { replicate-sign-bit , the-input };

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= {24'b1, in};
    end

endmodule
```

The `always` block ensures that the output is updated on every positive edge of the clock. The `24'b1` value is used to replicate the sign bit 24 times. The `in` value is the 8-bit number that needs to be sign-extended. The output is a 32-bit number with the sign bit in the MSB position and the 8-bit number in the LSB positions.
