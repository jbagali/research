Here is a possible implementation of a JK flip-flop with only a D-type flip-flop and gates:

```
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input j,
    input k,
    output Q);

    reg Qold;
    D flip_flop (
        input D,
        input clk,
        output Q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        Qold <= Q;
        Q <= (j & ~k) | (~j & k) & Qold;
    end

endmodule
```

The D flip-flop is configured to have a D input and a clock input. The output of the D flip-flop is Q. The always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The Qold register stores the value of Q before the positive clock edge. The Q output is updated to the value of D if J and K are both 0, or if J is 1 and K is 0, and Qold is 0. Otherwise, Q is updated to the value of 1 if J and K are both 1, or if J is 0 and K is 1, and Qold is 1.
