Here is a Verilog code for a 4-bit priority encoder:

```
module top_module (
    input [3:0] in,
    output reg [1:0] pos  );

    // Insert your code here

    assign pos = (in[3] & 1) | (in[2] & 2) | (in[1] & 4) | (in[0] & 8);

endmodule
```

This code uses a 4-bit priority encoder to generate a 2-bit output that indicates which of the four input bits is high. The output is zero if none of the input bits are high.

The priority encoder is implemented using a 4-to-1 multiplexer. The four input bits are connected to the select lines of the multiplexer, and the output of the multiplexer is connected to the output of the priority encoder.

The multiplexer is configured so that the output is high if and only if the input bit that is high is connected to the select line that is also high. For example, if the input bit `in[3]` is high, then the output of the multiplexer will be high, regardless of the values of the other input bits.

The priority encoder is a useful circuit that can be used in a variety of applications. For example, it can be used to generate a 2-bit output that indicates which of four buttons has been pressed.
