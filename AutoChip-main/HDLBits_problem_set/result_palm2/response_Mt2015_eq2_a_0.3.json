Sure, here is a circuit that has two 2-bit inputs A[1:0] and B[1:0], and produces an output z. The value of z should be 1 if A = B, otherwise z should be 0.

```
module top_module ( input [1:0] A, input [1:0] B, output z ); 
	// Insert your code here
	
	assign z = (A == B);
endmodule
```

This circuit uses a 2-bit AND gate to compare the two inputs. The AND gate will output a 1 if both inputs are 1, and a 0 otherwise. The output of the AND gate is then connected to the output z.
