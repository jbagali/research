Sure, here is a Verilog code for 8 D flip-flops, all triggered by the positive edge of clk:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] q
);

    reg [7:0] q;
    reg [7:0] d_reg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d_reg;
        d_reg <= d;
    end

endmodule
```

This code uses a register to store the value of the D input, and then latches the value of the D input into the Q output on the positive edge of clk.
