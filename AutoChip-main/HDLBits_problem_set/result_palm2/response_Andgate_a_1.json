Here is a module that implements an AND gate:

```module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    // The AND gate output is 1 if and only if both inputs are 1.
    assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

The `AND` gate is a logic gate that implements the logical AND function. The output of the AND gate is 1 if and only if both inputs are 1. The AND gate is a basic building block in digital electronics and is used in many different circuits.
