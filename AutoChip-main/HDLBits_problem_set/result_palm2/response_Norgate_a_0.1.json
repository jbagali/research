Sure, here is a module that implements a NOR gate in Verilog:

```module top_module(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out);

    always @(a or b) begin
        out <= !(a | b);
    end

endmodule
```

This module has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. The `always` block is triggered whenever either `a` or `b` changes. The output `out` is set to 1 if both `a` and `b` are 0, and 0 otherwise.
