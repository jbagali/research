The following code will build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).

```
module top_module( output one );

// Insert your code here
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
```

The `assign` statement assigns the value of the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side. In this case, the value of `1'b1` is assigned to the variable `one`. This will cause the output `one` to always be driven by a logic high.
