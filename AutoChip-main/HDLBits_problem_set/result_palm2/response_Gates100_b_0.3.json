Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor 
);

    always @(in) begin
        out_and = reduce(and, in);
        out_or = reduce(or, in);
        out_xor = reduce(xor, in);
    end

endmodule
```

The `reduce` operator takes a function and a list of values, and returns the result of applying the function to each element of the list. In this case, we are using the `and`, `or`, and `xor` functions to compute the AND, OR, and XOR of the 100 inputs.

The `always` block is executed whenever the inputs change. The `reduce` operator is evaluated for each input, and the results are stored in the outputs.
