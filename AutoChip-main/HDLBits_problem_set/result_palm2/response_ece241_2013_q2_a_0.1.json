The output out_sop in minimum SOP form is:

```
out_sop = a' + b' + c' + d' + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd
```

The output out_pos in minimum POS form is:

```
out_pos = !a + !b + !c + !d + !ab + !ac + !ad + !bc + !bd + !cd
```

To arrive at these solutions, we first need to identify the prime implicants of the function. A prime implicant is a product term that is essential to the function and cannot be removed without changing the function's output. In this case, the prime implicants are:

* $a'$
* $b'$
* $c'$
* $d'$
* $ab$
* $ac$
* $ad$
* $bc$
* $bd$
* $cd$

We can then use these prime implicants to construct the minimum SOP and POS forms of the function. The minimum SOP form is the sum of all the prime implicants, while the minimum POS form is the product of all the prime implicants.

In this case, the minimum SOP form is:

```
out_sop = a' + b' + c' + d' + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd
```

and the minimum POS form is:

```
out_pos = !a + !b + !c + !d + !ab + !ac + !ad + !bc + !bd + !cd
```
