Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] anyedge
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
            anyedge[i] <= (in[i] & ~prev_in[i]) | (~in[i] & prev_in[i]);
        end
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a D flip-flop to store the previous value of the input signal, and then compares it to the current value to detect any changes. The output signal is set to 1 the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.
