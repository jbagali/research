Sure, here is a module that implements a NOT gate:

```
module top_module( input in, output out );

  assign out = !in;

endmodule
```

This module has two ports: an input port `in` and an output port `out`. The output port is connected to the inverse of the input port. This means that if the input is 1, the output will be 0, and vice versa.
