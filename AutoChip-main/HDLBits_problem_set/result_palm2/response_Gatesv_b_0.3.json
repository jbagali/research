Here is a possible implementation of the top module:

```module top_module( 
    input [3:0] in,
    output [2:0] out_both,
    output [3:1] out_any,
    output [3:0] out_different );

    assign out_both = in[1:0] & in[2:1];
    assign out_any = in[0:2] | in[1:3];
    assign out_different = in[0:3] ^ in[1:2];

endmodule
```

The `out_both` output is a 2-bit vector that indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher index) are '1'. For example, `out_both[2]` should indicate if `in[2]` and `in[3]` are both 1. This can be implemented using a 2-input AND gate, as follows:

$$out_both = in[1:0] & in[2:1]$$

The `out_any` output is a 3-bit vector that indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, `out_any[2]` should indicate if either `in[2]` or `in[1]` are 1. This can be implemented using a 3-input OR gate, as follows:

$$out_any = in[0:2] | in[1:3]$$

The `out_different` output is a 3-bit vector that indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, `out_different[2]` should indicate if `in[2]` is different from `in[3]`. This can be implemented using a 3-input XOR gate, as follows:

$$out_different = in[0:3] ^ in[1:2]$$
