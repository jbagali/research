Here is a possible implementation of a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog:

```module top_module(
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output out);

    wire [255:0] sel_mask = 1 << sel;
    assign out = in[sel_mask];

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a 256-bit mask to select the desired bit from the input vector. The mask is created by shifting a 1 bit to the right by the sel value. The output is then the AND of the input vector and the mask.

Here is a possible implementation of a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer in VHDL:

```library IEEE;
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;

entity top_module is
    port (
        in : std_logic_vector (255 downto 0);
        sel : std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
        out : std_logic);
end top_module;

architecture Behavioral of top_module is
    signal sel_mask : std_logic_vector (255 downto 0);

    begin
        sel_mask := 1 << sel;
        out <= in & sel_mask;
    end Behavioral;
end top_module;
```

This implementation uses a similar approach to the Verilog implementation. The mask is created by shifting a 1 bit to the right by the sel value. The output is then the AND of the input vector and the mask.
