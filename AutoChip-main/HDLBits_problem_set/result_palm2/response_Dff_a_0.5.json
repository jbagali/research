Sure, here is a Verilog code for a single D flip-flop:

```module top_module (
    input clk,    // Clocks are used in sequential circuits
    input d,
    output reg q );//

    // Use a clocked always block
    //   copy d to q at every positive edge of clk
    //   Clocked always blocks should use non-blocking assignments

always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
```

This code uses a clocked always block to copy the value of the input signal `d` to the output signal `q` at every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The always block is clocked, which means that it will only execute when the clock signal changes state. The non-blocking assignment ensures that the value of `q` is updated immediately, even if the clock signal changes state before the assignment has completed.
