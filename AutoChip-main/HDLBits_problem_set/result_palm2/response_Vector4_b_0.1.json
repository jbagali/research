Here is a Verilog code that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits:

```module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign out = { replicate-sign-bit , the-input };

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= {24'b0, in};
    end

endmodule
```

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The `out` signal is assigned the value of the `in` signal, with 24 copies of the sign bit (the most significant bit) of `in` concatenated to the left.
