Here is a Verilog code that builds a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.
```
module top_module(
    input [2:0] a,
    input [2:0] b,
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);

    wire [2:0] or_bitwise;
    wire or_logical;
    wire [5:0] not_a;
    wire [5:0] not_b;

    or_bitwise = a | b;
    or_logical = a or b;
    not_a = ~a;
    not_b = ~b;

    assign out_not[5:3] = not_b;
    assign out_not[2:0] = not_a;

endmodule
```
