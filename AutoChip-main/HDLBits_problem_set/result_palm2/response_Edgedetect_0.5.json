Here is a possible implementation of the top_module module:

```module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] pedge
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
            if (in[i] == 0 && in[i + 1] == 1) begin
                pedge[i] <= 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This module uses a D flip-flop to detect when the input signal changes from 0 to 1. The D flip-flop is clocked by the clk signal, and its input is the in signal. The output of the D flip-flop, pedge, is set to 1 the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs on the in signal.
